            The Peugeot family of Valentigney, Montbéliard, Franche-Comté,
            France began in the manufacturing business in the 19th century. In
            1842, they added production of coffee, pepper, and salt grinders.
            The company's entry into the vehicle market was by means of
            crinoline dresses, which used steel rods, leading to umbrella
            frames, saw blades, chisels, wire wheels, and bicycles. Armand
            Peugeot introduced his "Le Grand Bi" penny-farthing in 1882, along
            with a range of other bicycles. The company's logo, initially a lion
            walking on an arrow, symbolized the speed, strength and flexibility
            of the Peugeot saw blades. The car company and bike company parted
            ways in 1926 but Peugeot bicycles continued to be built until very
            recently.

            Peugeot was an early pioneer in motor racing, with Albert Lemaître
            winning the world's first motor race, the Paris–Rouen, in a 3 hp
            Peugeot. Five Peugeots qualified for the main event, and all
            finished. Lemaître finished 3 min 30 sec behind the Comte de Dion
            whose steam-powered car was ineligible for the official competition.
            Three Peugeots were entered in the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris, where they
            were beaten by Panhard's car (despite an average speed of 20.8 km/h
            (12.9 mph) and taking the 31,500 franc prize. This also marked the
            debut of Michelin pneumatic tyres in racing, also on a Peugeot; they
            proved insufficiently durable. Nevertheless, the vehicles were still
            very much horseless carriages in appearance and were steered by a
            tiller.
